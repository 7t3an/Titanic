# ðŸš¢ Titanic EDA

This project explores the Titanic dataset and performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights about passenger survival.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- **Source:** Titanic dataset from Kaggle (train.csv and test.csv)
- **Features:** PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
- Understand which features influenced survival
- Visualize data distributions and relationships
- Extract insights for potential predictive modeling

## ðŸ›  Technologies / Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- plotly (optional)
- warnings

## ðŸ”Ž EDA Steps
1. Loading and inspecting data
2. Handling missing values
3. Data visualization:
   - Survival rates by gender, class, and age
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Feature distributions
4. Insights and conclusions

## âš¡ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
